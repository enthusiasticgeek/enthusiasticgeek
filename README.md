- 👋 Hi, I’m @enthusiasticgeek
- 👀 I’m interested in solving problems and later optimizing them in any programming language whether C/C++, Python, Java, etc. or even HDLs like VHDL. I primarily work on Linux in embedded systems (Love working with Device tree, Linux Drivers, Yocto, Buildroot). Work experience range on hardware ranging from Nvidia Jetson boards (AGX, NX, TX2, Nano, etc), AT91SAM, TI, STM32, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning RUST and Machine Learning as well as brushing up existing skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps solve issues and help improve lives for humans and nature (love plants, animals, birds, and other life on our planet).
- 📫 How to reach me - message me with good ideas that adhere to the above mentioned traits.
